We are currently thinking of a series of 3 hour sessions (short course? workshop? tutorial!), hands-on, with approximately the following sequencing:

-  basics: git (including the much overlooked idea, even in CS/DS, of creating tags/releases)
-  basics: programming structure (a non-CS look into functions, subprograms, etc. to allow for re-usable code - high level for social scientists)
-   basics: data provenance (best practices in acquiring data, manipulating data, documenting data provenance)

followed by a series of programming-language specific tutorials, that apply the above basics to two (three?) concrete case studies (one simple, one complex, one a GIS example). So

- {simple, complex, maps }  x  { Stata, Matlab, R, Python, maybe SPSS as a sop to old-style, maybe Julia as the new kid on the block }

Each participant would be expected to participate in 6 sessions, but could participate in all 15 sessions (18 if we include SPSS).

That's a lot to cover. But that's not all: I do not like transient information. What I would see coming out of this is a website / educational resource - able to be taught in universities as a 1-2 credit course), with targeted (not crowd-sourced) contributions from the presenters. With the twist: because they will all follow the SAME case studies, and will be asked to follow the SAME sequence/structure, one can flip the website from, say, Stata to R to Matlab, to see how each approach is done, both conceptually, and in practice.

We would recruit discipline-specific experts in each of the languages (for Stata, R, and Julia, I have economists that I trust to do the right thing), for the basics part, we would probably leverage but adapt software carpentry-style classes (and possibly contribute back, but that's up to them to see - maybe easy to get an incubator accepted, but probably not to post yet another variation of git).
